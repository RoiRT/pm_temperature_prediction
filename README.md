#  Rotor temperature prediction of a permanent magnet synchronous motor using different deep learning models.


## Description

With the growing relevance of electric motors in the industry, especially in the automotive sector with the proposed ban on combustion vehicles, there is a clear need to improve this technology. In rotor temperature prediction, current physical models are accurate but require a significant amount of time and resources. On the other hand, the rise of artificial intelligence presents opportunities with Deep Learning models, but further research is needed to determine the best approach and understand how different parameters affect the prediction accuracy.
